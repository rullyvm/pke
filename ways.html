## More Ways to Help

### I’ve donated, but now what?

**_Share._** The single most important thing you can do now is to share this
site and the message and the idea.

**If you have a blog or website, you can use the banners and buttons on our [embed page](/pke/embed) to get the word out.**

You can tweet, facebook, or blog the
campaign using the social media markers on the main page. Be sure to use the name of the site, MAYDAY.US, and the hashtag
#MaydayPAC.

You can also add our tracking widget by including this code in your site:

    <iframe src="https://mayday.us/campaigns/may-one/?widget=1" width="260px" height="260px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" /></iframe>

<a name="share_email" id="share_email"></a> The next step toward making the
Mayday super PAC successful is reaching out to friends, neighbors, and
colleagues, and *expanding* our reach. Can you help by sending a message to
your network about this campaign?

There are easy ways to do this —like *sharing* on Twitter and Facebook — but
the most impactful way is through a personal e-mail message. Here’s an
example:

> Giving money to a super PAC is one of the last things I thought I’d ever do… but I just did.

> I recently joined Lawrence Lessig’s citizen-funded Mayday PAC, an ambitious campaign
to win a Congress committed to ending corruption in 2016, and we did something
amazing: we reached over $5 million in pledges in just one month - with only 9 hours to spare before the deadline!

> That’s a ton of money, but it’s not enough. Now begins the hard part - running campaigns to change five districts during this election cycle, in a way that makes it clear that the most important issue was the role that money plays in politics.

> I’m writing to my
friends and family to ask them to find out more about the Mayday PAC's mission of electing a Congress dedicated to reform by 2016, and learning how they plan to do so through citizen-funded campaigns. And, if they agree with the plan and the message, to pass the word on further.

> I don’t have to tell you why this is important. We all know our government is
dismally dysfunctional because politicians spend all their time raising money
instead of doing the jobs they were elected to do. So our plan is to fight fire
with fire: raise the money needed to elect representatives that are committed to
the reform we so desperately need.

> You can read all about the Mayday PAC via our web site, https://mayday.us, but once you do,
please consider joining me in spreading the word. It’d mean the
world to have your support.

> Yours, (Your name here)

### Do you have some buttons I can use?

Yes we do: go to our [Social Buttons & Embedded Graphics page](/pke/embed)

### What more beyond *sharing*?

Create and pester.

*Create:* Tell your story. Tell this story. Explain to your friends why this
issue matters. And through that telling, you will help us understand how to
make it more compelling. Use the #MaydayPAC hashtag, and again, be
sure to share what you’ve created with us and with your friends.

*Pester:* We will win only when we have a majority in Congress committed to
fundamental reform. If you go to [reform.to](http://reform.to), you can see
where your representatives stand on fundamental reform. If they’re on the wrong
side, pester them to get on the right side. And if you convert someone, let us
know.

I can’t stress this enough: Only by sending personal appeals to the people in
your support networks, online and off, will we reach people, especially those
who desperately want to fix the problems that the influence of money in
politics causes, but have become so cynical they dare not get their hopes up.
Tell them what we’ve accomplished so far – and what we hope to accomplish. But
most importantly, let them know that their support is extremely important to
**you.**



### Can I sign up to volunteer online?

Yes! When you [sign up for our newsletter](/pke/subscribe?email=), you will have an opportunity
to volunteer and share your skills with us.


### What about offline?

Spread the word, face to face. Talk to people in your social groups, your
clubs, and ask them to support MAYDAY.US. Get people together and organized working
for change. Contact your local Congressman and tell them that you want
legislation that provides for citizen-funded elections, and if they’re not
receptive, let people know.


### I’m not an American, but I want to help.

If you’re not a citizen or permanent resident of the U.S., unfortunately you
cannot donate, but you can still volunteer with technical help, or help to spread the message. And remember – the issues we fight for here are issues in
every democracy. Be sure to get informed and involved locally.

### Can I connect with other supporters of the Mayday PAC?

Sure!  We have a variety of ways to connect:

* Join our [Facebook Group](//www.facebook.com/groups/282646648577039/).
